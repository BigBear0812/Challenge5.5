Challenge5.5
============

Challenge 5.5 - HTML, JS, CSS
This is a two-part challenge. If you have not done the first part be sure to check it out.
 
 
Part 2 - Pagination:
 
Using what you learned from the first challenge, create a new jQuery plugin for displaying pages of data. Here are the requirements:
It must handle an unlimited number of pages!
It must work in every major browser (IE7+).
It must be a jQuery plugin.
It must use the BrownBagAPI.
The BrownBagAPI is a small but extensive database I created for prototyping applications. It is self-documenting and inter-connected but still primitive. More information can be found at the link above.

Make your own layout and style. Clients will always want something that looks appealing, so don't skimp when it comes to looks.

Hints:

Your paging plugin should start out feeling very similar to the tab plugin, but now you must consider a remote data source.
Since the data is in JSON format, think about how you are going to display that data on the screen (string concat, templates, data-binding, etc.)
